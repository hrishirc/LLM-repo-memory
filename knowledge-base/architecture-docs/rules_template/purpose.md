# Rules Template Purpose

## Overview
The Rules Template project provides a standardized framework for establishing and maintaining consistent documentation practices across projects, focusing on architecture documentation, workflow management, and knowledge sharing.

## Business Problem Solved
This project addresses the challenges of inconsistent documentation practices, inefficient knowledge sharing, and lack of standardization in project documentation. It provides a structured approach to maintaining high-quality, consistent documentation across projects.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Documentation Standardization**: Establish and maintain consistent documentation structures and formats
- **Workflow Management**: Provide and automate predefined workflows for common documentation tasks
- **Knowledge Management**: Centralize and organize project documentation effectively
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure documentation completeness, accuracy, and adherence to standards

## Target Users/Consumers
- Development Teams: For maintaining project documentation
- Project Managers: For tracking documentation status
- Technical Writers: For creating and updating documentation
- Quality Assurance Teams: For validating documentation
- New Team Members: For onboarding and learning
- External Contributors: For understanding project structure

## Key Business Value
1. **Consistency**: Ensures uniform documentation across projects
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces time spent on documentation setup and maintenance
3. **Quality**: Maintains high standards for documentation through templates and validation
4. **Scalability**: Supports growth and evolution of projects through standardized practices
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Facilitates easier onboarding and knowledge sharing

## Scope
