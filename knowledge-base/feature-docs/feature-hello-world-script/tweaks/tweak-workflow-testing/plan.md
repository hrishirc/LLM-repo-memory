# Tweak Development Plan: Change 'Hello, World!' to 'workflow testing'

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to modify the `hello_world.py` script to change its output from "Hello, World!" to "workflow testing". This is a simple text modification to align the script with its new purpose as a workflow testing placeholder.

## Logical Parts
This tweak consists of a single logical part:
1.  **Modify Script Output**: Directly change the string literal in the `print()` statement.

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Modify Script Output
- **Objective**: Update the `hello_world.py` file to print "workflow testing" instead of "Hello, World!".
- **Implementation Approach**:
    - Locate the `hello_world.py` file in the `hello-world-script/` directory.
    - Open the file.
    - Find the line containing `print("Hello, World!")`.
    - Change the string literal to `"workflow testing"`.
- **Affected Files**:
    - `hello-world-script/hello_world.py`
- **Unit Tests**: Not applicable for this simple text change.
- **Integration Tests**: Manual verification by running the script and observing the console output.

## Dependencies
- None. This change is self-contained within the `hello_world.py` file.

## Execution Sequence
1.  Execute the "Modify hello_world.py" task.
2.  Execute the "Run Script and Confirm Output" task.

## Scalability, Performance, and Maintainability
- This change has no impact on scalability or performance.
- Maintainability is preserved as it's a simple text change.

## Error Handling
- No specific error handling is required for this change. If the file cannot be modified, the operation will fail.
