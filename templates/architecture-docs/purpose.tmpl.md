## Core Responsibilities
[List the key responsibilities and functionalities of this module. Be specific and use bullet points.]
- Responsibility 1: [e.g., Manage user authentication and authorization]
- Responsibility 2: [e.g., Process payment transactions securely]
- ...

## Target Users/Consumers
[Identify the primary users (e.g., end-users with specific roles, other internal teams) or systems (e.g., other microservices, third-party integrations) that interact with or depend on this module.]

## Key Business Value
[Describe the value this module brings to the business or project. How does it contribute to overall goals (e.g., increased revenue, improved efficiency, better user experience)?]

## Scope
### In Scope
[List functionalities and areas that are explicitly part of this module.]
- Feature A
- Process X
### Out of Scope
[List functionalities and areas that are explicitly NOT part of this module to avoid ambiguity and manage expectations.]
- Feature B (handled by Y module)
- Process Z (future consideration)

## Success Metrics (Optional)
[If applicable, list key metrics that define the success or performance of this module from a business perspective.]
- Metric 1: [e.g., User sign-up rate > X%]
- Metric 2: [e.g., Average transaction processing time < Y ms]

## Historical Context & Background (Optional)
[Include if relevant: Why was this module created? What preceded it? Any migration or replacement context that provides useful background.]

## Special Considerations & Constraints
[Document any unique aspects that don't fit standard categories but are important for understanding this module's purpose:]
- **Regulatory/Compliance Requirements**: [e.g., GDPR compliance for data handling, PCI DSS for payment processing]
- **Legacy System Integrations**: [e.g., Must maintain compatibility with legacy mainframe system X]
- **Business Rule Exceptions**: [e.g., Special handling for enterprise customers vs. standard users]
- **Seasonal/Temporal Constraints**: [e.g., Must handle 10x traffic during Black Friday, batch processing windows]
- **Geographic/Regional Considerations**: [e.g., EU data residency requirements, localization needs]
- **Vendor Dependencies**: [e.g., Critical dependency on third-party service X with specific SLA requirements]
- **Internal Politics/Organizational Context**: [e.g., Shared ownership with Team Y, temporary solution pending Team Z's roadmap]

## Additional Context
[Catch-all section for any other relevant information that doesn't fit the above categories but is important for understanding this module's purpose and context. Examples might include:]
- Experimental features or proof-of-concept elements
