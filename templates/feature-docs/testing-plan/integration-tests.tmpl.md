# Integration Testing Plan: {{feature_name}}

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the integration testing strategy for the `{{feature_name}}` feature, covering end-to-end scenarios and interactions between different system components.

## 2. Testing Approach
- **Automated vs. Manual:** [Specify if testing will be automated, manual, or a hybrid approach. Reference `feature-global-context.md` for global configuration.]
- **Tools/Frameworks:** [List of tools or frameworks used for integration testing, e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Postman, custom scripts.]

## 3. Integration Test Scenarios

### 3.1. Scenario 1: [Descriptive Name of End-to-End Workflow]
- **Description:** [Brief description of the workflow being tested.]
- **Preconditions:** [Any setup required before executing the test.]
- **Steps:**
  1. [Step 1: User action or system event]
  2. [Step 2: Expected system response/interaction]
  3. [Step 3: Verification point]
- **Expected Outcome:** [What is the successful result of this scenario?]
- **Affected Components:** [List of components/services involved in this scenario.]

### 3.2. Scenario 2: [Descriptive Name of API Integration]
- **Description:** [Testing interaction between two specific APIs or services.]
- **Preconditions:** [e.g., Service A is running, valid authentication token.]
- **Steps:**
  1. [Step 1: Call API X with specific payload]
  2. [Step 2: Verify response from API X]
  3. [Step 3: Verify data consistency in database/Service Y]
- **Expected Outcome:** [Successful data transfer, correct status codes, etc.]
- **Affected Components:** [List of APIs/services involved.]

### 3.3. Scenario 3: [Descriptive Name of Error Handling/Edge Case]
- **Description:** [Testing how the system handles specific error conditions or unusual inputs.]
- **Preconditions:** [e.g., Invalid input, service dependency down.]
- **Steps:**
  1. [Step 1: Trigger error condition]
  2. [Step 2: Verify error message/status code]
  3. [Step 3: Check logging/alerting systems]
- **Expected Outcome:** [Graceful degradation, appropriate error messages, system stability.]
- **Affected Components:** [List of components/services involved.]

## 6. Performance Testing Considerations
Briefly mention any performance aspects to be covered during integration testing.

## 7. Security Testing Considerations
Briefly mention any security aspects to be covered during integration testing.

## 8. Execution and Reporting
