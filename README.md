## Key Components

### 1. Workflow System

The workflow system provides structured approaches for different development scenarios:

- **Feature Development**: Complete workflow for new feature implementation
- **Tweak Development**: Streamlined process for enhancements and bug fixes
- **Architecture Documentation**: Guidelines for maintaining system documentation
- **Core Development**: Fundamental development practices and standards

### 2. Knowledge Management

Centralized knowledge management through:

- **Architecture Documentation**: System design and component relationships
- **Feature Documentation**: Requirements, specifications, and implementation details
- **Development Context**: Active development tracking and decision history

### 3. Platform-Specific Rules

Optimized rule configurations for different AI coding assistants:

#### Cursor
```bash
.cursor/rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules.mdc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.mdc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implement.mdc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug.mdc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory.mdc
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ directory-structure.mdc
```

#### CLINE
```bash
.clinerules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ directory-structure
```

## Setup Guide

### Basic Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy platform-specific rules to your project:
   ```bash
   # For Cursor
   cp -r .cursor/rules/ /path/to/your/project/.cursor/
   
   # For CLINE
   cp -r .clinerules/ /path/to/your/project/
   ```
3. Initialize knowledge base structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p knowledge-base/{architecture-docs,feature-docs}
   ```
4. Copy workflow definitions:
   ```bash
   cp -r workflow/ /path/to/your/project/
   ```

### Advanced Configuration

#### Custom Modes Setup

1. **Chat Mode**
   - Purpose: Comprehensive thinking and analysis
   - Configuration: No file operations
   - Token optimization: Minimal context loading

2. **Write Mode**
   - Purpose: File operations and command execution
   - Capabilities: Read, write, and execute
   - Token optimization: Efficient file handling

3. **MCP Mode**
   - Purpose: MCP server operations
   - Integration: Seamless mode switching
   - Token optimization: Focused server interactions

## Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Management
- Start with the workflow router for task categorization
- Follow appropriate workflow based on task type
- Document decisions and changes in knowledge base

### 2. Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date architecture documentation
- Document feature requirements and specifications
- Track development context and decisions

### 3. Token Optimization
- Use appropriate modes for different tasks
- Load context selectively
- Leverage efficient file operations

## üöÄ LLM Installation Prompts & Manual Setup

This section provides ready-to-use prompts for LLM-based coding assistants and manual instructions for installing the rules/templates into any project.

### ü§ñ LLM Prompt: Fresh Install (Create)

> **Prompt for LLMs:**
>
> Please install the rules from [https://github.com/hrishirc/LLM-repo-memory](https://github.com/hrishirc/LLM-repo-memory) into my current project.
> 1. Check if the directory `~/rules_template_install` (Unix/macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\rules_template_install` (Windows) already exists. If it does, pull the latest changes from the repository using `git pull`. If it doesn't exist, clone the repository from `https://github.com/hrishirc/LLM-repo-memory` into that default folder, or ask me for a location.
> 2. Run the `scripts/install_rules.sh` (for Unix/macOS) or `scripts/install_rules.cmd` (for Windows) script with the `create` argument, providing the path to my project if known. If not, ask me for it.
> 3. The script should copy the following folders/files into my project:
>     - `workflow/`
>     - `templates/`
>     - `.cursor/`
>     - `.clinerules/`
>    Only copy files that do not already exist. If a file exists, skip it. If a directory exists, ignore the error and continue.
> 4. Confirm completion.

### ü§ñ LLM Prompt: Update (Overwrite)

> **Prompt for LLMs:**
>
> Please update the rules in my current project from [https://github.com/hrishirc/LLM-repo-memory](https://github.com/hrishirc/LLM-repo-memory).
> 1. Check if the directory `~/rules_template_install` (Unix/macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\rules_template_install` (Windows) already exists. If it does, pull the latest changes from the repository using `git pull`. If it doesn't exist, clone the repository from `https://github.com/hrishirc/LLM-repo-memory` into that default folder, or ask me for a location.
> 2. Run the `scripts/install_rules.sh` (for Unix/macOS) or `scripts/install_rules.cmd` (for Windows) script with the `update` argument, providing the path to my project if known. If not, ask me for it.
> 3. The script should copy the following folders/files into my project:
>     - `workflow/`
>     - `templates/`
>     - `.cursor/`
>     - `.clinerules/`
>    Overwrite any existing files with the new versions. If a directory exists, ignore the error and continue.
> 4. Confirm completion.

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation (for Human Users)

1. **Clone this repository** to a folder of your choice.
2. **Run the install script** from the `scripts/` directory:
   - On Unix/macOS:
     ```sh
     bash scripts/install_rules.sh create /path/to/your/project
     # or for update (overwrite):
     bash scripts/install_rules.sh update /path/to/your/project
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```cmd
     scripts\install_rules.cmd create C:\path\to\your\project
     :: or for update (overwrite):
     scripts\install_rules.cmd update C:\path\to\your\project
     ```
3. **If you do not provide the project path as an argument, the script will prompt you for it.**

---

**Note:**
- In `create` mode, existing files are never overwritten.
- In `update` mode, all files are overwritten with the latest versions from this repo.
- Directory existence errors are ignored.
- The scripts are idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
